          <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content"><p>Belatedly (ie. on Dec 30th), I realized that if I wanted to get my 2019 portfolio update done (an annual yak shaving tradition that, according to my commit history, has fallen to the wayside), I had precisely two days in which to do so. I call it yak shaving because I didn't have any real incentive to do so, only that I indulge in it as a way to refresh some rustier working knowledge and to try out some new process changes (generously, improvements) on a well-defined problem. That being said, my 2017 portfolio hasn't quite aged gracefully over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses npm to trigger a nanoc build, which means that it required both node and ruby to run and that's a bit excessive.</li>
<li>I vaguely recall testing it on mobile but it hasn't held up, it seems</li>
<li>jQuery!!!</li>
<li>My current browser set up blocks CDNs which means the jQuery dependency renders my own portfolio unusable to me ðŸ˜‚</li>
<li>I literally haven't added any projects to it since 2017</li>
<li>I still haven't started writing like I always sort of probably planned to</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, it wasn't a portfolio I wanted going into 2020 and what I have now...also isn't! It's kind of messy and only sort of works and was literally the bare minimum I could get thrown together in the last 2 days of this decade but it's here! That's apparently more than I can say for whatever other personal project I've been working on since 2017! There's no better way to end a year than to pretend like you've been productive the entire time by going on a hackathon bender!</p>
<p>There's of course, still work to be done on it. I've left myself some notes in the form of <code>TODO</code> statements and if you've found this page, as of writing, you're poking around my commit history because there's no way to access anything I write from the front-end yet! I'm hoping to put more time into personal projects this year (and this decade) and maybe actually write more than once a year this time around despite evidence to the contrary. After all, it's a new decade - anything could happen!</p>
<p>ðŸ¥‚ Cheers!</p>
